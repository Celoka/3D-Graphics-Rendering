# 3D Graphics with Pygame

This project is a 3D rendering of objects using pygame. Credit to DLC Energy.

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites
Use the requirements file in the root folder to create a virtual env.
- To create a virtualenv, run:
```
python3 -m venv venv
```
- Activate the virtualenv:
```
source venv/bin/activate
```
- Install the dependencies for the project:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
- To deactivate the virtualenv:
```
deactivate
```
- Run the script:
```
python graphics.py
```
### Improvements
- I observed that certain parts of the code could as well be modularized.
This was done to enhance readability and also easy to maintain codebase incase this projects grows.
